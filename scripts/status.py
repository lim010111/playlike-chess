"""Regenerate STATUS.md for whatever project is the current working directory.

Vendored copy of the global status harness (`~/.claude/scripts/status.py`) so
CI can run it without access to the user's home directory. Keep this in sync
with the global copy.

- The project root is the current git toplevel (falling back to cwd).
- It acts ONLY when the project has issue files at `.scratch/*/issues/*.md`
  (the local-markdown issue-tracker convention). Any other repo is a silent
  no-op, so the global Stop hook is harmless everywhere.

The mechanical sections (issue table, progress bar) are fully regenerated, and
a staleness banner is added when the narrative provably contradicts the issue
state. The narrative block between the two markers is preserved verbatim — that
is the only part a human or the /status skill edits. Drift is impossible by
construction: the table is always a projection of the issue files.
